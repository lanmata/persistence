/**
 * Entity representing an audit event for logging and security purposes.
 * This class maps to the {@code general.audit_event} table in the database.
 *
 * Each instance of this entity records information about a specific security-
 * related event triggered by a user or within an application context.
 * It includes details such as the type of event, the user and application
 * involved, the client's IP address, and a timestamp when the event occurred.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Stores a caller-generated UUID as the primary key.
 * - Includes information about the user, application, and type of event.
 * - Captures client metadata such as IP address and user-agent.
 * - Provides a JSON field for event-specific details.
 * - Automatically sets timestamps for event occurrence and record creation.
 *
 * This class leverages JPA annotations for ORM and Hibernate-specific
 * annotations for JSON support.
